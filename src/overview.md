## Cross Validation Setup
- Training Set: Task Generator (with some varieties)
- Validation Set: Task Generator Accuracy (unseen tasks)
- Test Set: Manually created Tasks

## Plots
- Training/Validation Accuracy Plots + Test Score of final model
  - Test score will naturally be lower than validation score, as these human generated tasks are more diverse and complex than the automated task generation process
